      Welcome to Original Scotland </div> 
      <div>I'm Pippa Bullock, an artist living and working amidst the magic of Scotland's West Coast and Hebrides. Here, the oldtimers say the veil between our world and the divine is "thin," and it's in this space that I create. For me, painting a landscape isn't about replicating a scene; it's about interpreting nature's voice and sharing that conversation with you through each piece I create.
